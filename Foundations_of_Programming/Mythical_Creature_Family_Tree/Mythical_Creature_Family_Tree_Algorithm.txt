Mythical Creature Family Tree - Algorithm

Set Up the Tree
- Start by creating a class CreatureNode to represent each mythical creature.
- Each node stores a creature's name and has up to two children (left and right).

Building the Family Tree
- The tree starts empty.
- The user can add a root creature if one doesn't exist.
- Additional creatures can be added as left or right children of existing ones.

Adding Creatures
- The user picks a creature that already exists in the tree.
- They choose whether to add the new creature as a left or right child.
- The program checks if that spot is empty—if it is, the new creature is added.

Printing the Tree
- The program displays all creatures in a tree-like format.
- If the tree is empty, it lets the user know.

Searching for a Creature’s Ancestors
- The user inputs a creature’s name.
- The program searches the tree for that creature.
- If found, it prints out its ancestors in order.
- If not found, it notifies the user.

User Menu
- The user is given a menu to:
- Add a creature.
- Print the whole tree.
- Search for a creature’s ancestors.
- The menu keeps looping until the user decides to exit.
