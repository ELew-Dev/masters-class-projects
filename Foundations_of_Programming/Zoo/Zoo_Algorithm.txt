Zoo Animal Program - Algorithm

1. The Base Class: Animal
   - Every animal has a `name` and `species`
   - It has two functions:
     - `make_sound()`: A placeholder for animal sounds
     - `info()`: Prints out basic details about the animal

2. Making Specific Animals
   - Bear:
     - Has a `fur_color` (like brown, white, etc.)
     - `make_sound()`: Roars like a bear
     - `info()`: Also includes fur color
   
   - Elephant:
     - Has a `weight` (in kg)
     - `make_sound()`: Trumpets like an elephant
     - `info()`: Also includes weight
   
   - Penguin:
     - Has a `height` (in feet)
     - `make_sound()`: Squawks like a penguin
     - `info()`: Also includes height

3. Main Program & Menu
   - We store all animals in a list called `zoo`
   - Main Menu:
     - 1) Add animals
     - 2) Show all animals
     - 3) Show specific types
     - 4) Exit
   
   - Adding Animals:
     - User picks an animal type and enters details
     - The new animal gets added to `zoo`
   
   - Show All Animals:
     - Loops through `zoo` and prints out `info()` for each one
   
   - Show Specific Animals:
     - User selects Bear, Elephant, or Penguin
     - Prints only those animals
   
   - Exit:
     - Ends the program
